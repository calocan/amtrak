        <td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Before you retort with a quip about AMTRAK, I&rsquo;d ask that you contemplate the feeling of sitting </span><span
                class="c0">in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">AMTRAK&rsquo;s</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;plush seats, perhaps beside your traveling partner, maybe even across a table from your scenery-entranced children, or better still those pleasant journeys when you shelled out for a sleeping car or, failing that, you realize you&rsquo;re going to keep two seats to yourself for the whole trip. Now consider that as your </span><span
                class="c0 c9">ride</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is gliding smoothly and nearly silently down a railroad free of cross-traffic and ugly billboards and strip malls, you have the option of getting up at anytime and walking to the relief of a large bathroom or to a staffed caf&eacute;
            car for a coffee, beer, or snack. Such possibilities don&rsquo;t exist in a car, bus, or plane, and they aren&rsquo;t offered on other forms of urban railroads, namely metro (subway) or lightrail, or streetcar. You couldn&rsquo;t even be as comfortable in a car or plane unless you pay for something extravagant like a private tour bus or a business-class ticket on Emirates Airlines.</span>
        </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">AMTRAK is rightly critiqued for its mediocre travel speeds, schedules, the limited reach of </span><span
                    class="c0">its</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;network, and most of all for the infuriating lack of reliability on all of those tracks that it does not own. But the comfort of riding on AMTRAK when everything is running optimally is frankly excellent, better in comfort than coach class of many of the European passenger trains to which we so aspire. This is especially true of the newer double-decker AMTRAK trains west of the Mississippi, like Northern California&rsquo;s Capitol Corridor, which do not suffer from the copy-a-cramped-airplane design of the outdated single-level East Coast trains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Throughout the history of public transit, we&rsquo;ve assumed that metro, trams (I</span><span
                    class="c0">&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;use this </span><span
                    class="c0">European</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;catchall for lightrail and streetcars (a.k.a trolleys)), and buses cannot offer the same level of comfort as a regional train. But worse than that, we have come to accept the idea that urban transit cannot even be as comfortable as a private car, even with all the latter&rsquo;s comfort failings. Most consequently, public officials nearly always ignore the user-experience of transit while obsessing exclusively about capital and operations costs, leading to the perverse goal of trying to pack as many passengers as possible into a as few vehicles as possible without losing too many discretionary riders. Where we do pay attention to user-experience, it is merely an obsession with safety and legal mandates, the result being negative outcomes like glaring interior lights at night to deter crime, rules of behavior plastered all over the vehicles with no actual enforcement, and full ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) compliance within the cramped interior of a bus (ADA compliance makes for a better experience for everyone, but only when vehicle size is large enough, as we&rsquo;ll discuss later.) The obsession over cost-efficiency, safety, and accessibility would be excellent standards for public transit user-experience if they weren&rsquo;t our only standards. Because we neglect the rest of the user-experience, our systems are designed for the lowest common denominators, making the ride for everyone somewhere between mildly uncomfortable and miserable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would it mean to design all public transit to the AMTRAK standard in terms of the </span><span
                    class="c0">user-experience</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;of riding in vehicles and accessing them at AMTRAK&rsquo;s best stations? Let&rsquo;s look at some major aspects of user-experience and how they might be applied to metro, trams, and buses and their access areas. Afterward we&rsquo;ll discuss how to implement and pay for these improvements, and how to maintain them.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Smoothness and comfort of vehicle travel</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">To experience maximum smoothness we must travel in fixed-guideway vehicles. Fixed-guideway most often means vehicles that run on steel tracks with steel wheels or cement tracks with fixed rubber tires (rubber tires are occasionally used for metro systems and frequently for people movers at airports and monorails). Less common fixed guideway vehicles are gondolas (aerial trams) and magnetic levitation (mag-lev) trains. A bus that travels in its own lane has </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">dedicated right-of-way (ROW)</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;but is not fixed guideway. Such buses are typically branded as bus rapid transit (BRT). Trolley buses (those with overhead wires for power) are also not quite fixed-guideway, since their power source is fixed but not the tires. I regularly ride in both fixed-guideway vehicles and buses, and a bus&rsquo;s forward progress feels to me like sitting in the back seat of a jalopy with broken shocks, whereas fixed guideway gives me a unique sensation of sliding along--how would you describe each one?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">BRT buses (and others) can run somewhat smoother if the pavement is kept in excellent condition and if they use electric motors. </span><span
                    class="c0">However</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;today&rsquo;s low-floor buses, which are designed for limited mobility boarding, are extremely sensitive to pavement irregularities. Articulated buses can also suffer from vertical pivoting at the articulation points. I generally find that even the eighty-plus-year-old trams in San Francisco and New Orleans run smoother than modern city buses. Smoothness really matters; it is first of the many disadvantages of BRT (and airplanes) to user-experience that I want to highlight in order to contradict urban planners and officials who incorrectly tout BRT as good enough with a cheaper down payment than rail. I doubt those advocates spend much time on both buses and trams.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">In addition to smoothness, comfort is greatly impacted by the number of changes of acceleration (change in acceleration is appropriately called jerk), and especially from those changes that are unexpected. Manually driven buses and trams are subject to irregular acceleration by drivers, and even BRT buses make horizontal adjustments within their lane, both of which decrease the comfort of travel by jerking riders. When trams and buses lack their own dedicated ROW, the result is frequent, intense jerks for both modes plus frequent lane changes and pull-outs by buses.</span>

                    class="c0">ROW</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;means that lanes are dedicated to the transit vehicle and any intersections with streets are grade-separated (elevated above or submerged below the street level) or fully protected by crossing signals. Metros and regional trains always have class A right-of-way--they are never blocked by cross-traffic aside from trains on the same railway. Class B ROW is similar to A but without complete priority at intersections&mdash;transit vehicles might have </span><span
                    class="c0">to</span><span
                    class="c0">&nbsp;wait at red lights while cars cross. Trams and BRT buses </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">should</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;always have at least Class B, which can approximate class A in terms of lack of stops if the transit vehicle has signal priority--meaning the ability to change its traffic signal to green as it approaches. The lowly Class C ROW means vehicles operating in mixed traffic (no dedicated right-of-way). Class C vehicles </span><span
                    class="c0">are</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;a lost cause in terms of comfort (not to mention predictability) since they will inevitably make unexpected stops when their lane is shared by cars, bikes, and other users of the road. Class C should be reserved for low-ridership bus lines where no congestion ever occurs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sadly many new trams in the USA have been recently constructed with some or all Class C ROW (the systems in question are the smaller streetcars rather than the more heavy duty light-rail). Such planning failures have recently occurred in Portland, OR, Seattle, Washington DC, and are planned for Los Angeles. Many of America&rsquo;s traditional streetcars were removed in part because of their ineffectiveness in mixed traffic. Boston and Toronto perpetuate this error on some of their old lines. In terms of buses, BRT by definition should have Class B ROW, </span><span
                    class="c0">but</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in the USA it has almost always been compromised to a mix of Class B and C right-of-way, with the somewhat reasonable psychology that full Class B right-of-way is too valuable to dedicate to a bus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The other enemy of smooth, continuous travel is the placement of designated stops or stations </span><span
                    class="c0">too</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;close together. This is most common for buses but also occurs with many old and new trams in America. The frequency of stops is not just an unpleasant physical sensation but also fuels the mental angst of inefficient movement and wasted time. The ratio of a rider&rsquo;s average travel time to number of designated stops is a good indicator of whether or not the rider will suffer discomfort from stops that are too frequent. Another huge time-waster is passengers lining up to pay the driver of a bus or tram. It is ridiculous that any transit vehicle in modern times should make riders enter through only one door and then allow them waste time counting out change. Proof-of-payment combined with choosing between online or on-board fare machine purchase (place in the middle of each car) are now trivial to implement and accessible to all income levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Let&rsquo;s contemplate some rough numbers about travel time. A regional train rider might comfortably stop every five to thirty minutes, depending on population density of the region. For me, stopping every five minutes for a half-hour ride feels comfortable, whereas doing so for a three hour ride is not--every twenty minutes for three hours would be. Since metros, trams, and buses have shorter average travel times, the number of stops is more critical. For a fifteen minute ride I would easily tolerate a scheduled stop every two minutes. But for a half-hour ride probably only every five minutes. The magic feel-good number on any transit is probably about five to eight stops for an average trip. Keep in mind that this only includes scheduled stops and assumes that no other stops occur due to lack of right-of-way or unexpected obstacles. Put another way, trams and buses averaging 15-20 mph (25-32 km/h) including 10-20 second stops (dwell time) should space stops at least a half-mile apart, thus stopping once within every 90-120 second window in the most dense urban areas, and further apart as population dwindles. Another good rule-of-thumb is that trams and buses should always be at least as fast as a moderate cyclist traveling without interruption, or similarly at least as fast as a car that is stopping regularly at intersections. As a cyclist I like to ride when I&rsquo;m in the mood, but I should suffer any time hit for throwing my bike on the tram.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Expectations</span><span
                    class="c4 c1 c0">&nbsp;about fullness of vehicles</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c6"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Like AMTRAK, transit vehicles should never be standing room only and should generally have </span><span
                    class="c0">several</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;open spots per car to choose from. This includes during commute hours! Standing room-only is acceptable only in exceptional situations, such as very bad whether, major events (e.g. a sports stadium emptying), or minor emergencies (e.g. a bridge closure that paralyzes car traffic). We should declare crush-load situations a catastrophic failure except in the case of major emergencies (e.g. a hurricane or earthquake). We expect the equivalent discomfort in a private car during these times (e.g. being stuck in traffic for hours or giving strangers a lift to help get everyone out of town). Avoiding standing room only conditions is vital because it keeps center aisles clear for the movement of passengers and thus reduces claustrophobia and anxiety about reaching an exit. It also makes it far more efficient for officials to check tickets and enforce good behavior, both of which we&rsquo;ll cover at length later.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Comfort of seating</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Assuming a predilection for sitting while traveling (some people like me prefer to stand after a long day of </span><span
                    class="c0">sitting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at work), what would the seating conditions be? First and foremost, we all want easy access to an open seat, without searching or asking for permission to get around someone. This means that we glance around expectantly for two empty seats forming a row or a single empty seat if single-seat rows exist. Failing that we&rsquo;ll acquiesce to an open aisle seat next to a well-behaved </span><span
                    class="c0">stranger</span><span class="c0">. If you think about it, sitting down next to somebody on an airplane or train isn&rsquo;t quite as nice as an empty row to yourself (unless it&rsquo;s a party environment), but it&rsquo;s fine as long as the person is well groomed and keeps to themselves when you want them to. Most of us like plush seats if they can be guaranteed to be </span><span
                    class="c0">reasonably</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;clean, perhaps as clean as a train or airplane seat. Classy wooden seats are occasionally okay, especially on historical vehicles (like the St. Charles streetcar in New Orleans) or novelly located in designated parts of new vehicles, like the end sections of Munich&rsquo;s new U-Bahn </span><span
                    class="c0">cars</span><span class="c2 c0">. Plastic seats, metal seats, or seats with unpadded fabric are the worst seat in terms of comfort, save for a backless bench (which I&rsquo;ve never experienced outside of open-air sightseeing train cars).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Other important characteristics of seats are their situations and orientation. The height above the </span><span
                    class="c0">ground</span><span
                    class="c0">&nbsp;matters (e.g. small luggage should fit under </span><span
                    class="c0">seats</span><span class="c0">), as do the height of backrests, the amount of legroom, the orientation of the seats (forwards, backwards, or sideways), presence or lack of armrests between seats, the possibility of reclining a </span><span
                    class="c0">seat</span><span class="c2 c0">, and the presence of protrusions from the floor, such as bus wheel-wells. Another common problem is the presence of wind blocks, small barriers perpendicular to the doors, as well as seats that are configured at a right-angle to one another so the side of one seat invades the legroom of another. Seat qualities like armrests and reclining seats may seem like a ridiculous luxury for metros, trams, and city buses (they are common on long distance buses), but the truth is that we have these luxuries when we drive just five minutes in a car, so why shouldn&rsquo;t we at least consider them for transit trips that are less than an hour?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Again, let&rsquo;s look at the AMTRAK standard and passenger trains in general to discover the ideals. Passenger rail only uses sideways seats in observation cars where users want to look straight out the </span><span
                    class="c0">window</span><span class="c2 c0">. Inward facing seats are almost unheard of, except perhaps plush corner seats of old parlor cars. Many people like inward facing seats on metro because you never have to climb over a neighbor to reach one. Generally speaking, if vehicles are not overcrowded, meaning nobody is standing involuntarily and there are many empty rows of seats to choose from, then forward-facing seats (plush with plenty of legroom) are probably the ideal. I&rsquo;ll cede to anyone who prefers the inward facing seats of metros, but I think it&rsquo;s largely because they work better in crowded trains. Backwards seats are often used for bidirectional train cars or for seats grouped in four (which should always have a table between them). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The use of backward seats in buses to squeeze in more seats is </span><span
                    class="c0">problematic</span><span class="c2 c0">. Modern low-floor buses must have giant wheel well protrusions that encourage backwards facing seats to cover more of the wheel well. Such seats are nauseating and make it very difficult for us to see when our stop is approaching. Whenever rear-facing, I have to stare at my iPhone&rsquo;s GPS location on the map so I know when to get off.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Much of seat design centers on maximizing the number of seats, maximizing standing room for crowded vehicles, and maximizing the design to withstand wear-and-tear and be easily cleanable. It&rsquo;s okay to make durable seats if comfort is not compromised. The quantity and layout of the seats should put comfort first, with the understanding that the solution to crowded transit vehicles can only be more major increases in transit vehicles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Another area of consideration for seating is the proximity to nuisances, such as forced air being blown through the ventilation system, harsh lighting at night, motors--especially of diesel buses but also diesel-multiple-unit (DMU) trains and even electric motors--and doors of trains that frequently open and close, exposing passengers to uncomfortable noises and variations in temperature. These nuisances can and must be minimized.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Expectations about the amount of personal space and privacy</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Privacy on transit vehicles might seem like a non-starter. But if we can enforce good behavior on </span><span
                    class="c0">transit</span><span class="c0">, which we must begin to do, then some privacy is possible. </span><span
                    class="c0">Long-distance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;AMTRAK trains typically offer sleeper cars, which are a sensible and delightful luxury on long trips. Sleepers give passengers the ability to lie horizontally overnight and to sit during the day in an enclosed space alone, with their travel companion, or even with their whole family. Private automobiles offer a similar level of privacy but without the ability to escape the confined space. European trains historically offered private or shared compartments for the upper classes and later to all </span><span
                    class="c0">classes</span><span class="c0">. These compartment trains are disappearing in favor of North American style row </span><span
                    class="c0">seating</span><span class="c2 c0">, but there are at times advantages to choosing a quiet room with four or six strangers rather than a loud car with a hundred people. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Should regional trains, metros, trams, and buses offer private space for an extra fee? Let&rsquo;s first assume that such private space could be seamlessly purchased on board with a smartphone or reserved online, and that the technology would allow passengers to unlock a compartment. Such a feature would require the level of good-behavior that is expected on long distance AMTRAK trains. People wouldn&rsquo;t try to invade your paid for compartment, nor would inappropriate activity be tolerated in compartments (drugs, loud music, sex, etc.) There would likely be no visual privacy, just a glass door, which would prevent most bad behavior. In which vehicles, if any, would this work? Certainly regional trains could offer paid compartments. The compartments barely take more room than row seating if they were configured as four seats that you could reserve in part or full. But more expensive one or two seat compartments for business travelers might also be practical. How about on metro? Do private compartments make any sense for a ride that&rsquo;s less than an hour? Maybe, if the reason to rent it is to get some table room to conduct business or a quiet space to take a nap after work. </span><span
                    class="c0">On</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;trams and buses the answer is almost certainly no, but other private amenities like bathrooms might make sense there. Let&rsquo;s discuss that next.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Access to amenities inside of </span><span class="c1 c0">vehicles</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bathrooms and caf&eacute; cars are wonderful amenities on AMTRAK and some commuter trains. </span><span
                    class="c0">Long-distance</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;AMTRAK trains also have sleeping compartments, dining cars, showers, dressing rooms, sight-seeing cars, parlor cars, spaces with toys for kids to play, and even movie rooms. We should treasure these features of long-distance train travel, it is perhaps the highest order of public transportation comfort alongside cruise ships or overnight ferries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span
                    class="c0">Let&rsquo;s begin with bathrooms because they satisfy such a fundamental </span><span
                    class="c0">need</span><span class="c0">. Most regional trains have bathrooms, as do some long-distance buses, although the bathrooms of the buses often come at the expense of the unlucky passengers having to sit next to them. Metros and trams almost never have bathrooms, which is a shame. The one exception I have experienced are the tram-trains in the Karlsruhe region of Germany. Tram-trains function both as regional trains and trams by switching from regional track to tram track when they get into the city. The dual mode means </span><span
                    class="c0">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;even when functioning as trams, the bathrooms are fully available, a remarkable convenience. Again assuming the enforcement of good behavior, it seems reasonable to allocate space on metros and trams for restrooms. Restrooms on trains generally work very well. I&rsquo;ve rarely encountered a messy restroom on a train unless the toilet or sink were backed up. If we can have good behavior on transit we should be able to support restrooms. One noteworthy challenge for metro cars is that the operations team </span><span
                    class="c0">prefer</span><span class="c0">s that all cars be identical in configuration, which would mean a restroom in every car. I think a compromise that puts a restroom in every other car and assumes a pretty even distribution of cars would be acceptable. If the cars are high-tech enough to signal where the the closest restroom is, people won&rsquo;t mind walking a couple cars. Again, this assumes that normal conditions on the metro are no standing-only passengers that block the aisles. New European metro cars are deploying with no doors between cars in favor of a single long corridor (called an open gangway). This would make finding a restroom much easier. Modern trams are similarly </span><span
                    class="c0">an</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;open gangway of attached units without doors, so one restroom at the ends or middle of the tram would work well. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A similar case can be made for caf&eacute; sections on metros and trams, but probably not buses due to </span><span
                    class="c0">the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;space constraints and the dangerous bumpiness walking around with a hot beverage. Even trains are shaky enough to recommend lids. Caf&eacute;
                sections could be as simple as a vending machine or two, and some bar style tables for passengers to stand around. All beverages on a metro or smaller transit vehicle would have to come with a sealed lid to prevent major spills. Once again, assume good behavior: Children are supervised by parents, adults by staff and other riders, allowing metro and tram operators to permit sealed beverages. Snack food could similarly be sold from machines, especially things that aren&rsquo;t messy (e.g. hot or cold sandwiches but not popcorn or Cheetos). But why, might you ask, do we need food and drinks on transit? For the same reason we do in a car or when we&rsquo;re walking down the street. We get hungry, thirsty, and/or want a little diversion and/or chance for social interaction. These yearnings are something that can perk up an otherwise routine trip. We should consider it a viable option on transit, whether or not the food is revenue positive or negative. One of my favorite parts of getting on AMTRAK is knowing I can go get a coffee, beer, or burrito whenever I want&mdash;-that represents economic value in itself; it makes me ride more often.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">The expectation of good behavior in vehicles and at stations</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Much of the better user-experience I&rsquo;ve outlined here relies on the enforcement of good </span><span
                    class="c0">behavior</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;on transit. It means people behave the way that we expect them to on a plane or AMTRAK train, or else face the chiding of a chipper flight attendant or wrath of a surly conductor. AMTRAK conductors do a very reasonable job of enforcing good behavior (as do flight attendants) to the point where bad behavior on AMTRAK is surprising. I do experience worse behavior on AMTRAK than airplanes, but it&rsquo;s mainly something benign like kids listening to music out loud on their phones. I can get myself worked up enough to tell them to turn their music off because I know it&rsquo;s bothering everyone else, and I have the conductor to back me up if there&rsquo;s any problem. I would never ask on the metro, tram, or bus for fear of getting assaulted, but also because bad behavior is so widespread on those modes that it&rsquo;s not worth the fight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why is bad behavior widespread on transit, aside from regional trains, and how can we quickly fix it? Behavior is in part worse because there are far more passengers and a greater socio-economic range of them getting on and off in crowded conditions, but the real problem is that there are no conductors on board to enforce good behavior. Should we </span><span
                    class="c0">have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;conductors on metro, trams, and buses? Yes, sort of. What we should have is what proof-of-payment systems ideally do. They have officials appear &ldquo;randomly&rdquo;
                on vehicles to check for proof of payment, which with modern technology they can check dozens of people per minute. These officials, since they are wandering the aisles anyway, should also be well-paid to enforce good behavior. They already have the power to warn or fine for fare violations, and they could additionally do so for breaking other </span><span
                    class="c0">rules</span><span class="c2 c0">. The point isn&rsquo;t to make money from fines, it&rsquo;s to maximize good behavior. For fare-paying riders, the presence of friendly but strict officials is generally welcome, as long as those officials are representative of the population, do their jobs well, and don&rsquo;t discriminate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now, if metro systems have faregates, how can they justify having officials checking payment and enforcing good behavior on-board? Germany already has this figured out. Get rid of the faregates! </span><span
                    class="c0">Faregates</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are an archaic vestige of the days when the only way to pay for the metro was with paper tickets or tokens. Even modern faregates that open by tapping a radio-frequency identification (RFID) card or smartphone are </span><span
                    class="c0">an</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;enormous inconvenience to paying customers. They bottleneck traffic in and out of metro stations. It&rsquo;s true that they prevent some fare evasion, but at what cost? The maintenance of mechanical equipment, its replacement when new technology comes online, and the wasted time and space is all extremely expensive, all in the name of inconveniencing the 95-plus% of people who gladly pay their fare, or at least would if they knew there was a good chance of being fined on-board for fare evasion. Faregates are also the minority means of paying to use transit. Regional trains and trams generally rely on proof-of-payment, and more and more buses not that technology enables rear-door boarding with card and smartphone scanners. Metro has traditionally used faregates because of the relatively low number of stations, which happen to already be constrained by being underground or elevated above ground. But station design suffers tremendously from faregates by forcing entire levels just for processing tickets. Imagine if users could take stairs or escalators straight to the platform level with no silly faregate bottlenecks! It would vastly improve station design by eliminating the segregated paid and unpaid areas. Elimination of faregates also frees up station agents to leave their adjacent &ldquo;guard towers&rdquo;
                and roam the station to assist passengers and enforce good behavior.</span></p>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bikes, wheelchairs, luggage, and packages all need to be accommodated on transit in order to give all potential users an excellent user-experience. Bikes are an essential part of the transportation system, and their small form factor and near ubiquitous ownership makes it reasonable for people to want to use the same bike on both ends of their transit trip. Bike share, folding bikes, and bike parking are great too, but not always as comfortable or convenient. Any regional train can be retrofitted </span><span
                    class="c0">or</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;designed to carry large numbers of bikes in a special section. It might be acceptable to charge people a little extra to bring their bike on board, as long as the fee acknowledges that bikes pack tightly together and decrease the cost of providing feeder transit services. My guess is that the reduced cost of feeder service and parking amenities is more than enough to warrant free bike boardings. Metro has plenty of space for bikes if the system is scaled up to eliminate the need for passengers to stand under normal conditions. Each metro car can typically fit about ten bikes per car comfortably, </span><span

                    class="c0">damage</span><span class="c2 c0">. Some buses have a bit of indoor bike space if they are articulated, but generally buses and bikes are a bad match since bus interior space is limited. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Freight and luggage should get dedicated space via overhead shelves, under seats, or in special luggage racks on all modes of transit. Again this is hardest on a bus where space is constrained. Bikes and freight are one of the many reasons that trams should replace all major bus routes, including BRT. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wheelchair</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;users should be able to board a transit vehicle just as easily as a person on foot. The vehicles must have level boarding for roll up rides and not require seat belts to secure the chair. With nobody standing there is always plenty of room for one or two wheelchairs per door of rail vehicles. Again </span><span
                    class="c0">buses</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;are a bad match for wheelchairs. Their large wheels give them a higher floor than trams, and lack of fixed guideway means being flush to platform is impossible. Thus level boarding requires elevated platforms with mechanical bus ramps as well as driver-assisted seatbelts to secure wheelchairs. Modern trams can arrive with their entryways horizontally and vertically flush with a normal curb.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The removal of faregates and plentiful elevators tremendously help out bikes and wheelchairs as well as luggage and personal freight. Other amenities such as luggage/bike conveyors that run alongside staircases are inexpensive additions that vastly improve </span><span

            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Transit Station and Transit Stop Amenities</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The days of a dark, dank, metro platform and transit stops exposed to wind, rain, and grime must </span><span
                    class="c0">come</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to an end. The first step is to limit stops to the spacings that I have suggested above, so that more resources and attention can be dedicated to the major stops. By having aesthetically pleasing and comfortable stops at named centers throughout a city and region, neighborhoods form their identity in part by their transit stop. It&rsquo;s already true of train stations and some metro stations, where people and businesses specifically dwell near the station to benefit from and give benefit to it. </span><span
                    class="c0">Such</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;development is also common around tram stops if the stops are strategically spaced to bring all comers and goers to a central meeting point for the neighborhood. A BRT stop might be able to simulate the feeling of an important stop if it can attract the level of passenger use and business situation that a fixed guideway transit stop does. I believe that BRT has not yet proven capable of this in America, partially because there are no BRT systems in America built to the full standards developed in South America, but also because of the inferior user-experience of riding any bus and lack of permanence that only a fixed guideway can convey.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In terms of physical amenities, an indoor train, metro, or tram station (some light-rail stations in North America are indoors) should be treated as a small indoor shopping area for purchasing daily essentials and frequenting leisure businesses like caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and bars. Major train stations and metro stations in Europe offer bakeries, produce markets, and pharmacies to convenience passengers. Any indoor station should have enough space for restrooms. Europe often provides turnstile or human-operated pay restrooms, which is reasonable in exchange for clean restrooms if you can easily make change for 50&cent;
                or pay with technology. Whether free or paid, abundant, clean, and safe are obvious requirements. I see no reason why self-cleaning sidewalk restrooms shouldn&rsquo;t </span><span
                    class="c0">be</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;at every outdoor tram or BRT stop, unless the vehicles themselves provide restrooms. There is nothing less dignified than being denied a toilet or sink when in need while using transit (or while driving or flying for that matter). Where such neglect occurs the result is often urine-soaked stairwells and sidewalks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Other major amenities, such as comfortable seating, good lighting, and protection from weather are as much about dignity as comfort. Riding transit such be considered a classy lifestyle, as much so as getting in a nice car, plane, or train is. This means that any stop or station should receive high quality upkeep just as an plane or train does. Again, we don&rsquo;t have to upkeep thousands of bus stops throughout a city. Instead we need to consolidate those to major stops and upgrade bus stops to tram stops so that they serve more passengers and thus justify their amenities. By having only major stops, it can become the job of a neighborhood business association or even paid local residents to upkeep their stop, which adds to the sense of community identity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">One gotcha of stop consolidation is caring for people with limited mobility who rely on stops near their home. My answer to this challenge is to humbly suggest that level boarding vehicles and improved streetscapes makes the overall experience better for those in wheelchairs and impaired walkers even if they had to make it a couple extra blocks to reach a major stop. Another possibility would be to have disabled-only stops. Such stops would be minor stops that could be requested by pushing a handicap stop request button in the area of the tram reserved for such travelers. Similarly trams would only pick such travelers at the front door for minor stops. This idea has some major flaws, namely adding otherwise unscheduled stops. The alternative is to provide paratransit to all those who cannot reach major stops, which is a messy but perhaps necessary solution that is already in wide use. What we must stop doing is spacing stops too close together, negatively impacting the majority of riders and weakening the amenities of major stops.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The only practical way to fund a vastly improved user-experience on transit is to increase the costs of driving and direct that enormous income to transit, supporting transportation modes, and public space infrastructure. Car use receives monstrosities of both explicit and implicit subsidies and causes incomparable social, economic, environmental, and health externalities. Driving must be reduced in most urban areas by at least 90 percent, and further curtailed in large cities of the First and Third World where it is already not the dominant mode of transportation. It follows that public transit supported by active transportation that is attractive to 90 percent of the population is the only scalable substitute for driving. Those who believe that transit should pay for itself through usage fees or subsist by current funding mechanisms are dooming transit to low mode share, dilapidation, and increasing catastrophic failures. Without significant revenue from the most wasteful and destructive activity on earth&mdash;driving and riding in private vehicles in urban areas&mdash;we are sending the message to users of sustainable modes of transportation that their choice cannot be as comfortable or even as safe as driving, even though all such modes are potentially more comfortable and safe than driving at a much lower per user cost. </span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those who believe that autonomous cars remove the need for transit have the argument backward. Autonomous cars are an excellent technological development that shall reduce the number of physical cars needed by an order of 90 percent in urban areas by replacing all private car use with an efficient taxi fleet. It means that most users will pay explicitly for each minute or mile of travel (just like with &Uuml;ber/Lyft or Car2Go), which incentivizes them to prefer alternative, cheaper modes or at least have the car deliver them to a transit stop. Privately owned cars have a large sunk cost, so there is little incentive not to use them, plus you can&rsquo;t abandon one at your destination and pick up another somewhere else. Given per-mile or minute costs, it makes no sense for thousands of autonomous cars to transport people on freeways or major roads, especially since environmental externalities of freeways and driving will increasingly be accounted for. It does make sense to replace center freeway lanes (two or more) with fixed guideway transit and to use autonomous cars to and from the transit stop in low density areas. Autonomous cars should eliminate most car trips and incentivise massive increases in transit and bike use. </span><span
                    class="c4 c1 c0">That makes it all the more essential to improve the user-experience of transit to welcome riders who are transitioning from car dependency to occasional autonomous car use.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is a politically reasonable way to increase car-usage fees in order to fund high-quality </span><span
                    class="c0">transit</span><span class="c0">. It begins with charging for car-ownership and usage in order to fund </span><span

                    class="c9 c0">specific corridor</span><span class="c2 c0">. For instance, a practical high priority transit improvement is to replace a bus that operates in mixed traffic on a four-lane road with a tram that receives exclusive use of two of the four lanes and enjoys signal priority at intersections. There are dozens of such corridors in the San Francisco Bay Area where I live. A heavy use area, such as Geary Blvd or Van Ness Ave in San Francisco, might instead justify an underground metro or tram. Regardless, the transit corridor should be funded by those who own cars within a half mile or a mile of the corridor and by those who currently drive on the corridor. A half mile radius would be appropriate for a tram since it means about a ten minute walk (or less) for anyone within that half mile. A mile or more radius would be appropriate for funding a metro or regional rail that can attract users from farther away by using bikes, trams, autonomous cars, or minor buses to reach it. As a simple example, consider a potential ten mile tram line that currently has </span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The (2) 100,000 vehicles using the corridor daily also pay on average $100 per year for parking surcharges (whether public or private parking), making another </span><span

                    class="c2 c0">&nbsp;would be generated each year to build and maintain the ten mile tram line and the infrastructure improvements to accompany it, without even considering ticket revenue and government funding. The financial hardship to the drivers is a pittance (at most $200/year for the combined vehicle ownership and parking surcharge), probably not even enough initially to significantly alter driving behavior. All of these fees would be increased yearly a bit beyond inflation to discourage car driving and ownership as the tram line and accompanying infrastructure became available and increasingly attractive to use, a double-win for transit use. Such financing schemes are simple and fair and need not be controversial if the people that use cars in a given corridor pay specifically for high-quality transit on that corridor. Arguably the car users are paying to decrease the congestion that they are causing (and suffering from), and thus all payments can be considered a corridor usage fee rather than a tax (this only matters for political and legal reasons). More transit-progressive cities and regions might be politically able to pool funds from the region to fund improvements throughout the region, but such funding severs the connection between the reward of abandoning a car and getting high quality transit in the place where one previously owned or used a car. In the likely case that autonomous cars eliminate most car ownership, a simple per mile or minute surcharge should be placed on the cars using the corridor to maintain transit funding.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0 c4">A Sample Charter for User-Experience on Transit</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The funding example above shows that simple, straightforward financing could provide plentiful revenue to support high quality transit. It does not in itself however incentivize transportation planners to provide riders with an excellent user-experience. User-experience is not just a financial challenge but a business and societal one as well. We need to start with a charter that stipulates the priorities of public transportation. Such a legally-binding charter would give equal weight to several priorities. For instance:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Preamble: Active-transportation-supported transit, not automobiles, is the only form of transportation that improves rather than denigrates the environment, equity, economy, social and public health, and urban aesthetics of cities and other settled places. A 90 percent or greater non-auto mode share shall be considered meeting the requirements of this charter. Such a percentage of mode-shift requires investment in high quality user-experience on transit to appeal to the vast majority of the population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">1. Expectation of overwhelming safety onboard, at stations, and on designated approaches to the transit. Safety is enforced by the frequent presence of friendly fare inspectors, conductors, and other officials. It is also enforced by dedicated right-of-way for the vehicles, frequent service, plentiful seating, a constant baseline of ridership (a minimum presence of riders mean safer vehicles), and failing all else complete coverage by surveillance cameras and the latest safety technology. Good behavior by all users of the system is strictly enforced by officials, to at least the level that it is enforced on AMTRAK or airplanes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">2. Expectation of convenience in terms of frequent, time-efficient vehicles. This is accomplished by investment in a high frequency schedule, even at off-peak times, and by eliminating all non-designated stops. Additionally stops are limited to neighborhood centers and important intersections so that average trips have a maximum of 5-8 stops, depending on the type of service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">3. Expectation of comfort approximating that of a regional train, or at least that of an airplane or private car. This is accomplished by almost always have a surplus of comfortable seats and access to amenities, such as bathrooms, caf&eacute;s, and private compartments that can be reasonably provided by the service type. It also means the ride is always smooth due to using a well maintained fixed guideway and the highest quality vehicles. Similarly stations and stops offer the level comfort and amenities of the best existing train stations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">4. Capital improvements, operations, and maintenance, and supporting public space infrastructure funding is adequate to easily meet the above expectations. Funding is not borne by the users of the system; users are expected to minimally support the system with fares so that they pay directly for a service and thus expect excellent value from it. The goal of the system is to maximize the percent of overall trips that might otherwise be done with a car (and by a plane in the case of high-speed-rail). Fares should be set to maximize usage and never revenue. The system shall therefore be funded to scale to comfortably support 90 percent mode-share between transit, bikes, and walking. 90 percent of transit funding should come from private car ownership, parking, driving, and taxi or autonomous car usage fees in order to remove the subsidies and externalities of cars and thus discourage them in favor of sustainable modes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">5. All revenues and expenditures are tightly scrutinized, but scrutinized with the goal of most effectively satisfying the aforementioned expectations. Funding is not scrutinized in order to minimize the level of service or maximize the occupancy load of vehicles. It is understood that a transit vehicle that is half to three-quarters full is the ideal, and mostly empty vehicles are preferable in terms of service quality to full vehicles with no available seating.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Conclusion</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Right now in the USA and elsewhere, there is a scarcity culture about infrastructure and especially public space and transit. The result is petty fighting among advocates concerning one transit corridor versus another, mis-investments in bad user-experience modes like bus rapid transit, and little ability to recognize that substantial and increasing fees on car use is the only way to restore our urban environments to a human-focus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The only solution, as I see it, is to change our thinking about what we want public transit and its accompanying amenities to be. We need to bring the best of American (or your country&rsquo;s) culture to transit, not the worst. In the case of American culture, this means friendly but orderly, It means a lot of comfort and a little luxury. It means plenty of free space and the chance to pay a little for privacy. It means good behavior that is enforced by officials along with the (often loud) encouragement by the public. It means getting around quickly without having to wait and fixing inefficiencies that arise. Americans also like fairness, and any sensible one of us can see that car use is unfair, whether in terms of allocation of public space or destroying the environment (and climate) in which others live. Let us use the money wasted on cars to achieve transit that has both abundance of service </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;abundance of excellent user-experience. They are both essential to the massive cultural appeal of transit, which we once possessed &nbsp;and must now regain.</span>

        <td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Before you retort with a quip about AMTRAK, I&rsquo;d ask that you contemplate the feeling of sitting </span><span
                class="c0">in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">AMTRAK&rsquo;s</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;plush seats, perhaps beside your traveling partner, maybe even across a table from your scenery-entranced children, or better still those pleasant journeys when you shelled out for a sleeping car or, failing that, you realize you&rsquo;re going to keep two seats to yourself for the whole trip. Now consider that as your </span><span
                class="c0 c9">ride</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is gliding smoothly and nearly silently down a railroad free of cross-traffic and ugly billboards and strip malls, you have the option of getting up at anytime and walking to the relief of a large bathroom or to a staffed caf&eacute;
            car for a coffee, beer, or snack. Such possibilities don&rsquo;t exist in a car, bus, or plane, and they aren&rsquo;t offered on other forms of urban railroads, namely metro (subway) or lightrail, or streetcar. You couldn&rsquo;t even be as comfortable in a car or plane unless you pay for something extravagant like a private tour bus or a business-class ticket on Emirates Airlines.</span>
        </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">AMTRAK is rightly critiqued for its mediocre travel speeds, schedules, the limited reach of </span><span
                    class="c0">its</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;network, and most of all for the infuriating lack of reliability on all of those tracks that it does not own. But the comfort of riding on AMTRAK when everything is running optimally is frankly excellent, better in comfort than coach class of many of the European passenger trains to which we so aspire. This is especially true of the newer double-decker AMTRAK trains west of the Mississippi, like Northern California&rsquo;s Capitol Corridor, which do not suffer from the copy-a-cramped-airplane design of the outdated single-level East Coast trains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Throughout the history of public transit, we&rsquo;ve assumed that metro, trams (I</span><span
                    class="c0">&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;use this </span><span
                    class="c0">European</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;catchall for lightrail and streetcars (a.k.a trolleys)), and buses cannot offer the same level of comfort as a regional train. But worse than that, we have come to accept the idea that urban transit cannot even be as comfortable as a private car, even with all the latter&rsquo;s comfort failings. Most consequently, public officials nearly always ignore the user-experience of transit while obsessing exclusively about capital and operations costs, leading to the perverse goal of trying to pack as many passengers as possible into a as few vehicles as possible without losing too many discretionary riders. Where we do pay attention to user-experience, it is merely an obsession with safety and legal mandates, the result being negative outcomes like glaring interior lights at night to deter crime, rules of behavior plastered all over the vehicles with no actual enforcement, and full ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) compliance within the cramped interior of a bus (ADA compliance makes for a better experience for everyone, but only when vehicle size is large enough, as we&rsquo;ll discuss later.) The obsession over cost-efficiency, safety, and accessibility would be excellent standards for public transit user-experience if they weren&rsquo;t our only standards. Because we neglect the rest of the user-experience, our systems are designed for the lowest common denominators, making the ride for everyone somewhere between mildly uncomfortable and miserable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">What would it mean to design all public transit to the AMTRAK standard in terms of the </span><span
                    class="c0">user-experience</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;of riding in vehicles and accessing them at AMTRAK&rsquo;s best stations? Let&rsquo;s look at some major aspects of user-experience and how they might be applied to metro, trams, and buses and their access areas. Afterward we&rsquo;ll discuss how to implement and pay for these improvements, and how to maintain them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Smoothness and comfort of vehicle travel</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">To experience maximum smoothness we must travel in fixed-guideway vehicles. Fixed-guideway most often means vehicles that run on steel tracks with steel wheels or cement tracks with fixed rubber tires (rubber tires are occasionally used for metro systems and frequently for people movers at airports and monorails). Less common fixed guideway vehicles are gondolas (aerial trams) and magnetic levitation (mag-lev) trains. A bus that travels in its own lane has </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">dedicated right-of-way (ROW)</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;but is not fixed guideway. Such buses are typically branded as bus rapid transit (BRT). Trolley buses (those with overhead wires for power) are also not quite fixed-guideway, since their power source is fixed but not the tires. I regularly ride in both fixed-guideway vehicles and buses, and a bus&rsquo;s forward progress feels to me like sitting in the back seat of a jalopy with broken shocks, whereas fixed guideway gives me a unique sensation of sliding along--how would you describe each one?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">BRT buses (and others) can run somewhat smoother if the pavement is kept in excellent condition and if they use electric motors. </span><span
                    class="c0">However</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;today&rsquo;s low-floor buses, which are designed for limited mobility boarding, are extremely sensitive to pavement irregularities. Articulated buses can also suffer from vertical pivoting at the articulation points. I generally find that even the eighty-plus-year-old trams in San Francisco and New Orleans run smoother than modern city buses. Smoothness really matters; it is first of the many disadvantages of BRT (and airplanes) to user-experience that I want to highlight in order to contradict urban planners and officials who incorrectly tout BRT as good enough with a cheaper down payment than rail. I doubt those advocates spend much time on both buses and trams.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">In addition to smoothness, comfort is greatly impacted by the number of changes of acceleration (change in acceleration is appropriately called jerk), and especially from those changes that are unexpected. Manually driven buses and trams are subject to irregular acceleration by drivers, and even BRT buses make horizontal adjustments within their lane, both of which decrease the comfort of travel by jerking riders. When trams and buses lack their own dedicated ROW, the result is frequent, intense jerks for both modes plus frequent lane changes and pull-outs by buses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The key to smooth and comfortable travel is giving vehicles Class A or B ROW. Class A </span><span
                    class="c0">ROW</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;means that lanes are dedicated to the transit vehicle and any intersections with streets are grade-separated (elevated above or submerged below the street level) or fully protected by crossing signals. Metros and regional trains always have class A right-of-way--they are never blocked by cross-traffic aside from trains on the same railway. Class B ROW is similar to A but without complete priority at intersections&mdash;transit vehicles might have </span><span
                    class="c0">to</span><span
                    class="c0">&nbsp;wait at red lights while cars cross. Trams and BRT buses </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">should</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;always have at least Class B, which can approximate class A in terms of lack of stops if the transit vehicle has signal priority--meaning the ability to change its traffic signal to green as it approaches. The lowly Class C ROW means vehicles operating in mixed traffic (no dedicated right-of-way). Class C vehicles </span><span
                    class="c0">are</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;a lost cause in terms of comfort (not to mention predictability) since they will inevitably make unexpected stops when their lane is shared by cars, bikes, and other users of the road. Class C should be reserved for low-ridership bus lines where no congestion ever occurs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sadly many new trams in the USA have been recently constructed with some or all Class C ROW (the systems in question are the smaller streetcars rather than the more heavy duty light-rail). Such planning failures have recently occurred in Portland, OR, Seattle, Washington DC, and are planned for Los Angeles. Many of America&rsquo;s traditional streetcars were removed in part because of their ineffectiveness in mixed traffic. Boston and Toronto perpetuate this error on some of their old lines. In terms of buses, BRT by definition should have Class B ROW, </span><span
                    class="c0">but</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in the USA it has almost always been compromised to a mix of Class B and C right-of-way, with the somewhat reasonable psychology that full Class B right-of-way is too valuable to dedicate to a bus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The other enemy of smooth, continuous travel is the placement of designated stops or stations </span><span
                    class="c0">too</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;close together. This is most common for buses but also occurs with many old and new trams in America. The frequency of stops is not just an unpleasant physical sensation but also fuels the mental angst of inefficient movement and wasted time. The ratio of a rider&rsquo;s average travel time to number of designated stops is a good indicator of whether or not the rider will suffer discomfort from stops that are too frequent. Another huge time-waster is passengers lining up to pay the driver of a bus or tram. It is ridiculous that any transit vehicle in modern times should make riders enter through only one door and then allow them waste time counting out change. Proof-of-payment combined with choosing between online or on-board fare machine purchase (place in the middle of each car) are now trivial to implement and accessible to all income levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Let&rsquo;s contemplate some rough numbers about travel time. A regional train rider might comfortably stop every five to thirty minutes, depending on population density of the region. For me, stopping every five minutes for a half-hour ride feels comfortable, whereas doing so for a three hour ride is not--every twenty minutes for three hours would be. Since metros, trams, and buses have shorter average travel times, the number of stops is more critical. For a fifteen minute ride I would easily tolerate a scheduled stop every two minutes. But for a half-hour ride probably only every five minutes. The magic feel-good number on any transit is probably about five to eight stops for an average trip. Keep in mind that this only includes scheduled stops and assumes that no other stops occur due to lack of right-of-way or unexpected obstacles. Put another way, trams and buses averaging 15-20 mph (25-32 km/h) including 10-20 second stops (dwell time) should space stops at least a half-mile apart, thus stopping once within every 90-120 second window in the most dense urban areas, and further apart as population dwindles. Another good rule-of-thumb is that trams and buses should always be at least as fast as a moderate cyclist traveling without interruption, or similarly at least as fast as a car that is stopping regularly at intersections. As a cyclist I like to ride when I&rsquo;m in the mood, but I should suffer any time hit for throwing my bike on the tram.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0 c6"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Like AMTRAK, transit vehicles should never be standing room only and should generally have </span><span
                    class="c0">several</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;open spots per car to choose from. This includes during commute hours! Standing room-only is acceptable only in exceptional situations, such as very bad whether, major events (e.g. a sports stadium emptying), or minor emergencies (e.g. a bridge closure that paralyzes car traffic). We should declare crush-load situations a catastrophic failure except in the case of major emergencies (e.g. a hurricane or earthquake). We expect the equivalent discomfort in a private car during these times (e.g. being stuck in traffic for hours or giving strangers a lift to help get everyone out of town). Avoiding standing room only conditions is vital because it keeps center aisles clear for the movement of passengers and thus reduces claustrophobia and anxiety about reaching an exit. It also makes it far more efficient for officials to check tickets and enforce good behavior, both of which we&rsquo;ll cover at length later.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Comfort of seating</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Assuming a predilection for sitting while traveling (some people like me prefer to stand after a long day of </span><span
                    class="c0">sitting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at work), what would the seating conditions be? First and foremost, we all want easy access to an open seat, without searching or asking for permission to get around someone. This means that we glance around expectantly for two empty seats forming a row or a single empty seat if single-seat rows exist. Failing that we&rsquo;ll acquiesce to an open aisle seat next to a well-behaved </span><span
                    class="c0">stranger</span><span class="c0">. If you think about it, sitting down next to somebody on an airplane or train isn&rsquo;t quite as nice as an empty row to yourself (unless it&rsquo;s a party environment), but it&rsquo;s fine as long as the person is well groomed and keeps to themselves when you want them to. Most of us like plush seats if they can be guaranteed to be </span><span
                    class="c0">reasonably</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;clean, perhaps as clean as a train or airplane seat. Classy wooden seats are occasionally okay, especially on historical vehicles (like the St. Charles streetcar in New Orleans) or novelly located in designated parts of new vehicles, like the end sections of Munich&rsquo;s new U-Bahn </span><span
                    class="c0">cars</span><span class="c2 c0">. Plastic seats, metal seats, or seats with unpadded fabric are the worst seat in terms of comfort, save for a backless bench (which I&rsquo;ve never experienced outside of open-air sightseeing train cars).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Other important characteristics of seats are their situations and orientation. The height above the </span><span
                    class="c0">ground</span><span
                    class="c0">&nbsp;matters (e.g. small luggage should fit under </span><span
                    class="c0">seats</span><span class="c0">), as do the height of backrests, the amount of legroom, the orientation of the seats (forwards, backwards, or sideways), presence or lack of armrests between seats, the possibility of reclining a </span><span
                    class="c0">seat</span><span class="c2 c0">, and the presence of protrusions from the floor, such as bus wheel-wells. Another common problem is the presence of wind blocks, small barriers perpendicular to the doors, as well as seats that are configured at a right-angle to one another so the side of one seat invades the legroom of another. Seat qualities like armrests and reclining seats may seem like a ridiculous luxury for metros, trams, and city buses (they are common on long distance buses), but the truth is that we have these luxuries when we drive just five minutes in a car, so why shouldn&rsquo;t we at least consider them for transit trips that are less than an hour?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Again, let&rsquo;s look at the AMTRAK standard and passenger trains in general to discover the ideals. Passenger rail only uses sideways seats in observation cars where users want to look straight out the </span><span
                    class="c0">window</span><span class="c2 c0">. Inward facing seats are almost unheard of, except perhaps plush corner seats of old parlor cars. Many people like inward facing seats on metro because you never have to climb over a neighbor to reach one. Generally speaking, if vehicles are not overcrowded, meaning nobody is standing involuntarily and there are many empty rows of seats to choose from, then forward-facing seats (plush with plenty of legroom) are probably the ideal. I&rsquo;ll cede to anyone who prefers the inward facing seats of metros, but I think it&rsquo;s largely because they work better in crowded trains. Backwards seats are often used for bidirectional train cars or for seats grouped in four (which should always have a table between them). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The use of backward seats in buses to squeeze in more seats is </span><span
                    class="c0">problematic</span><span class="c2 c0">. Modern low-floor buses must have giant wheel well protrusions that encourage backwards facing seats to cover more of the wheel well. Such seats are nauseating and make it very difficult for us to see when our stop is approaching. Whenever rear-facing, I have to stare at my iPhone&rsquo;s GPS location on the map so I know when to get off.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Much of seat design centers on maximizing the number of seats, maximizing standing room for crowded vehicles, and maximizing the design to withstand wear-and-tear and be easily cleanable. It&rsquo;s okay to make durable seats if comfort is not compromised. The quantity and layout of the seats should put comfort first, with the understanding that the solution to crowded transit vehicles can only be more major increases in transit vehicles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Another area of consideration for seating is the proximity to nuisances, such as forced air being blown through the ventilation system, harsh lighting at night, motors--especially of diesel buses but also diesel-multiple-unit (DMU) trains and even electric motors--and doors of trains that frequently open and close, exposing passengers to uncomfortable noises and variations in temperature. These nuisances can and must be minimized.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Expectations about the amount of personal space and privacy</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Privacy on transit vehicles might seem like a non-starter. But if we can enforce good behavior on </span><span
                    class="c0">transit</span><span class="c0">, which we must begin to do, then some privacy is possible. </span><span
                    class="c0">Long-distance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;AMTRAK trains typically offer sleeper cars, which are a sensible and delightful luxury on long trips. Sleepers give passengers the ability to lie horizontally overnight and to sit during the day in an enclosed space alone, with their travel companion, or even with their whole family. Private automobiles offer a similar level of privacy but without the ability to escape the confined space. European trains historically offered private or shared compartments for the upper classes and later to all </span><span
                    class="c0">classes</span><span class="c0">. These compartment trains are disappearing in favor of North American style row </span><span
                    class="c0">seating</span><span class="c2 c0">, but there are at times advantages to choosing a quiet room with four or six strangers rather than a loud car with a hundred people. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Should regional trains, metros, trams, and buses offer private space for an extra fee? Let&rsquo;s first assume that such private space could be seamlessly purchased on board with a smartphone or reserved online, and that the technology would allow passengers to unlock a compartment. Such a feature would require the level of good-behavior that is expected on long distance AMTRAK trains. People wouldn&rsquo;t try to invade your paid for compartment, nor would inappropriate activity be tolerated in compartments (drugs, loud music, sex, etc.) There would likely be no visual privacy, just a glass door, which would prevent most bad behavior. In which vehicles, if any, would this work? Certainly regional trains could offer paid compartments. The compartments barely take more room than row seating if they were configured as four seats that you could reserve in part or full. But more expensive one or two seat compartments for business travelers might also be practical. How about on metro? Do private compartments make any sense for a ride that&rsquo;s less than an hour? Maybe, if the reason to rent it is to get some table room to conduct business or a quiet space to take a nap after work. </span><span
                    class="c0">On</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;trams and buses the answer is almost certainly no, but other private amenities like bathrooms might make sense there. Let&rsquo;s discuss that next.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Access to amenities inside of </span><span class="c1 c0">vehicles</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bathrooms and caf&eacute; cars are wonderful amenities on AMTRAK and some commuter trains. </span><span
                    class="c0">Long-distance</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;AMTRAK trains also have sleeping compartments, dining cars, showers, dressing rooms, sight-seeing cars, parlor cars, spaces with toys for kids to play, and even movie rooms. We should treasure these features of long-distance train travel, it is perhaps the highest order of public transportation comfort alongside cruise ships or overnight ferries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span
                    class="c0">Let&rsquo;s begin with bathrooms because they satisfy such a fundamental </span><span
                    class="c0">need</span><span class="c0">. Most regional trains have bathrooms, as do some long-distance buses, although the bathrooms of the buses often come at the expense of the unlucky passengers having to sit next to them. Metros and trams almost never have bathrooms, which is a shame. The one exception I have experienced are the tram-trains in the Karlsruhe region of Germany. Tram-trains function both as regional trains and trams by switching from regional track to tram track when they get into the city. The dual mode means </span><span
                    class="c0">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;even when functioning as trams, the bathrooms are fully available, a remarkable convenience. Again assuming the enforcement of good behavior, it seems reasonable to allocate space on metros and trams for restrooms. Restrooms on trains generally work very well. I&rsquo;ve rarely encountered a messy restroom on a train unless the toilet or sink were backed up. If we can have good behavior on transit we should be able to support restrooms. One noteworthy challenge for metro cars is that the operations team </span><span
                    class="c0">prefer</span><span class="c0">s that all cars be identical in configuration, which would mean a restroom in every car. I think a compromise that puts a restroom in every other car and assumes a pretty even distribution of cars would be acceptable. If the cars are high-tech enough to signal where the the closest restroom is, people won&rsquo;t mind walking a couple cars. Again, this assumes that normal conditions on the metro are no standing-only passengers that block the aisles. New European metro cars are deploying with no doors between cars in favor of a single long corridor (called an open gangway). This would make finding a restroom much easier. Modern trams are similarly </span><span
                    class="c0">an</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;open gangway of attached units without doors, so one restroom at the ends or middle of the tram would work well. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A similar case can be made for caf&eacute; sections on metros and trams, but probably not buses due to </span><span
                    class="c0">the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;space constraints and the dangerous bumpiness walking around with a hot beverage. Even trains are shaky enough to recommend lids. Caf&eacute;
                sections could be as simple as a vending machine or two, and some bar style tables for passengers to stand around. All beverages on a metro or smaller transit vehicle would have to come with a sealed lid to prevent major spills. Once again, assume good behavior: Children are supervised by parents, adults by staff and other riders, allowing metro and tram operators to permit sealed beverages. Snack food could similarly be sold from machines, especially things that aren&rsquo;t messy (e.g. hot or cold sandwiches but not popcorn or Cheetos). But why, might you ask, do we need food and drinks on transit? For the same reason we do in a car or when we&rsquo;re walking down the street. We get hungry, thirsty, and/or want a little diversion and/or chance for social interaction. These yearnings are something that can perk up an otherwise routine trip. We should consider it a viable option on transit, whether or not the food is revenue positive or negative. One of my favorite parts of getting on AMTRAK is knowing I can go get a coffee, beer, or burrito whenever I want&mdash;-that represents economic value in itself; it makes me ride more often.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">The expectation of good behavior in vehicles and at stations</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Much of the better user-experience I&rsquo;ve outlined here relies on the enforcement of good </span><span
                    class="c0">behavior</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;on transit. It means people behave the way that we expect them to on a plane or AMTRAK train, or else face the chiding of a chipper flight attendant or wrath of a surly conductor. AMTRAK conductors do a very reasonable job of enforcing good behavior (as do flight attendants) to the point where bad behavior on AMTRAK is surprising. I do experience worse behavior on AMTRAK than airplanes, but it&rsquo;s mainly something benign like kids listening to music out loud on their phones. I can get myself worked up enough to tell them to turn their music off because I know it&rsquo;s bothering everyone else, and I have the conductor to back me up if there&rsquo;s any problem. I would never ask on the metro, tram, or bus for fear of getting assaulted, but also because bad behavior is so widespread on those modes that it&rsquo;s not worth the fight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why is bad behavior widespread on transit, aside from regional trains, and how can we quickly fix it? Behavior is in part worse because there are far more passengers and a greater socio-economic range of them getting on and off in crowded conditions, but the real problem is that there are no conductors on board to enforce good behavior. Should we </span><span
                    class="c0">have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;conductors on metro, trams, and buses? Yes, sort of. What we should have is what proof-of-payment systems ideally do. They have officials appear &ldquo;randomly&rdquo;
                on vehicles to check for proof of payment, which with modern technology they can check dozens of people per minute. These officials, since they are wandering the aisles anyway, should also be well-paid to enforce good behavior. They already have the power to warn or fine for fare violations, and they could additionally do so for breaking other </span><span
                    class="c0">rules</span><span class="c2 c0">. The point isn&rsquo;t to make money from fines, it&rsquo;s to maximize good behavior. For fare-paying riders, the presence of friendly but strict officials is generally welcome, as long as those officials are representative of the population, do their jobs well, and don&rsquo;t discriminate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now, if metro systems have faregates, how can they justify having officials checking payment and enforcing good behavior on-board? Germany already has this figured out. Get rid of the faregates! </span><span
                    class="c0">Faregates</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are an archaic vestige of the days when the only way to pay for the metro was with paper tickets or tokens. Even modern faregates that open by tapping a radio-frequency identification (RFID) card or smartphone are </span><span
                    class="c0">an</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;enormous inconvenience to paying customers. They bottleneck traffic in and out of metro stations. It&rsquo;s true that they prevent some fare evasion, but at what cost? The maintenance of mechanical equipment, its replacement when new technology comes online, and the wasted time and space is all extremely expensive, all in the name of inconveniencing the 95-plus% of people who gladly pay their fare, or at least would if they knew there was a good chance of being fined on-board for fare evasion. Faregates are also the minority means of paying to use transit. Regional trains and trams generally rely on proof-of-payment, and more and more buses not that technology enables rear-door boarding with card and smartphone scanners. Metro has traditionally used faregates because of the relatively low number of stations, which happen to already be constrained by being underground or elevated above ground. But station design suffers tremendously from faregates by forcing entire levels just for processing tickets. Imagine if users could take stairs or escalators straight to the platform level with no silly faregate bottlenecks! It would vastly improve station design by eliminating the segregated paid and unpaid areas. Elimination of faregates also frees up station agents to leave their adjacent &ldquo;guard towers&rdquo;
                and roam the station to assist passengers and enforce good behavior.</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 c1 c0">Personal transportation and freight on transit</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bikes, wheelchairs, luggage, and packages all need to be accommodated on transit in order to give all potential users an excellent user-experience. Bikes are an essential part of the transportation system, and their small form factor and near ubiquitous ownership makes it reasonable for people to want to use the same bike on both ends of their transit trip. Bike share, folding bikes, and bike parking are great too, but not always as comfortable or convenient. Any regional train can be retrofitted </span><span
                    class="c0">or</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;designed to carry large numbers of bikes in a special section. It might be acceptable to charge people a little extra to bring their bike on board, as long as the fee acknowledges that bikes pack tightly together and decrease the cost of providing feeder transit services. My guess is that the reduced cost of feeder service and parking amenities is more than enough to warrant free bike boardings. Metro has plenty of space for bikes if the system is scaled up to eliminate the need for passengers to stand under normal conditions. Each metro car can typically fit about ten bikes per car comfortably, </span><span
                    class="c0">which</span><span
                    class="c0">&nbsp;means up to a hundred bikes on a long train. </span><span
                    class="c0">Trams</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are long enough to have dedicated bike hangers, and many do, especially the larger American light-rail vehicles. Local buses offer rack space on the front of the bus, but they can never be relied upon to have an empty slot, and are at risk of theft and </span><span
                    class="c0">damage</span><span class="c2 c0">. Some buses have a bit of indoor bike space if they are articulated, but generally buses and bikes are a bad match since bus interior space is limited. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Freight and luggage should get dedicated space via overhead shelves, under seats, or in special luggage racks on all modes of transit. Again this is hardest on a bus where space is constrained. Bikes and freight are one of the many reasons that trams should replace all major bus routes, including BRT. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Wheelchair</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;users should be able to board a transit vehicle just as easily as a person on foot. The vehicles must have level boarding for roll up rides and not require seat belts to secure the chair. With nobody standing there is always plenty of room for one or two wheelchairs per door of rail vehicles. Again </span><span
                    class="c0">buses</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;are a bad match for wheelchairs. Their large wheels give them a higher floor than trams, and lack of fixed guideway means being flush to platform is impossible. Thus level boarding requires elevated platforms with mechanical bus ramps as well as driver-assisted seatbelts to secure wheelchairs. Modern trams can arrive with their entryways horizontally and vertically flush with a normal curb.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The removal of faregates and plentiful elevators tremendously help out bikes and wheelchairs as well as luggage and personal freight. Other amenities such as luggage/bike conveyors that run alongside staircases are inexpensive additions that vastly improve </span><span

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The days of a dark, dank, metro platform and transit stops exposed to wind, rain, and grime must </span><span
                    class="c0">come</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to an end. The first step is to limit stops to the spacings that I have suggested above, so that more resources and attention can be dedicated to the major stops. By having aesthetically pleasing and comfortable stops at named centers throughout a city and region, neighborhoods form their identity in part by their transit stop. It&rsquo;s already true of train stations and some metro stations, where people and businesses specifically dwell near the station to benefit from and give benefit to it. </span><span
                    class="c0">Such</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;development is also common around tram stops if the stops are strategically spaced to bring all comers and goers to a central meeting point for the neighborhood. A BRT stop might be able to simulate the feeling of an important stop if it can attract the level of passenger use and business situation that a fixed guideway transit stop does. I believe that BRT has not yet proven capable of this in America, partially because there are no BRT systems in America built to the full standards developed in South America, but also because of the inferior user-experience of riding any bus and lack of permanence that only a fixed guideway can convey.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In terms of physical amenities, an indoor train, metro, or tram station (some light-rail stations in North America are indoors) should be treated as a small indoor shopping area for purchasing daily essentials and frequenting leisure businesses like caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and bars. Major train stations and metro stations in Europe offer bakeries, produce markets, and pharmacies to convenience passengers. Any indoor station should have enough space for restrooms. Europe often provides turnstile or human-operated pay restrooms, which is reasonable in exchange for clean restrooms if you can easily make change for 50&cent;
                or pay with technology. Whether free or paid, abundant, clean, and safe are obvious requirements. I see no reason why self-cleaning sidewalk restrooms shouldn&rsquo;t </span><span
                    class="c0">be</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;at every outdoor tram or BRT stop, unless the vehicles themselves provide restrooms. There is nothing less dignified than being denied a toilet or sink when in need while using transit (or while driving or flying for that matter). Where such neglect occurs the result is often urine-soaked stairwells and sidewalks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Other major amenities, such as comfortable seating, good lighting, and protection from weather are as much about dignity as comfort. Riding transit such be considered a classy lifestyle, as much so as getting in a nice car, plane, or train is. This means that any stop or station should receive high quality upkeep just as an plane or train does. Again, we don&rsquo;t have to upkeep thousands of bus stops throughout a city. Instead we need to consolidate those to major stops and upgrade bus stops to tram stops so that they serve more passengers and thus justify their amenities. By having only major stops, it can become the job of a neighborhood business association or even paid local residents to upkeep their stop, which adds to the sense of community identity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">One gotcha of stop consolidation is caring for people with limited mobility who rely on stops near their home. My answer to this challenge is to humbly suggest that level boarding vehicles and improved streetscapes makes the overall experience better for those in wheelchairs and impaired walkers even if they had to make it a couple extra blocks to reach a major stop. Another possibility would be to have disabled-only stops. Such stops would be minor stops that could be requested by pushing a handicap stop request button in the area of the tram reserved for such travelers. Similarly trams would only pick such travelers at the front door for minor stops. This idea has some major flaws, namely adding otherwise unscheduled stops. The alternative is to provide paratransit to all those who cannot reach major stops, which is a messy but perhaps necessary solution that is already in wide use. What we must stop doing is spacing stops too close together, negatively impacting the majority of riders and weakening the amenities of major stops.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The only practical way to fund a vastly improved user-experience on transit is to increase the costs of driving and direct that enormous income to transit, supporting transportation modes, and public space infrastructure. Car use receives monstrosities of both explicit and implicit subsidies and causes incomparable social, economic, environmental, and health externalities. Driving must be reduced in most urban areas by at least 90 percent, and further curtailed in large cities of the First and Third World where it is already not the dominant mode of transportation. It follows that public transit supported by active transportation that is attractive to 90 percent of the population is the only scalable substitute for driving. Those who believe that transit should pay for itself through usage fees or subsist by current funding mechanisms are dooming transit to low mode share, dilapidation, and increasing catastrophic failures. Without significant revenue from the most wasteful and destructive activity on earth&mdash;driving and riding in private vehicles in urban areas&mdash;we are sending the message to users of sustainable modes of transportation that their choice cannot be as comfortable or even as safe as driving, even though all such modes are potentially more comfortable and safe than driving at a much lower per user cost. </span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Those who believe that autonomous cars remove the need for transit have the argument backward. Autonomous cars are an excellent technological development that shall reduce the number of physical cars needed by an order of 90 percent in urban areas by replacing all private car use with an efficient taxi fleet. It means that most users will pay explicitly for each minute or mile of travel (just like with &Uuml;ber/Lyft or Car2Go), which incentivizes them to prefer alternative, cheaper modes or at least have the car deliver them to a transit stop. Privately owned cars have a large sunk cost, so there is little incentive not to use them, plus you can&rsquo;t abandon one at your destination and pick up another somewhere else. Given per-mile or minute costs, it makes no sense for thousands of autonomous cars to transport people on freeways or major roads, especially since environmental externalities of freeways and driving will increasingly be accounted for. It does make sense to replace center freeway lanes (two or more) with fixed guideway transit and to use autonomous cars to and from the transit stop in low density areas. Autonomous cars should eliminate most car trips and incentivise massive increases in transit and bike use. </span><span
                    class="c4 c1 c0">That makes it all the more essential to improve the user-experience of transit to welcome riders who are transitioning from car dependency to occasional autonomous car use.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is a politically reasonable way to increase car-usage fees in order to fund high-quality </span><span
                    class="c0">transit</span><span class="c0">. It begins with charging for car-ownership and usage in order to fund </span><span

                    class="c9 c0">specific corridor</span><span class="c2 c0">. For instance, a practical high priority transit improvement is to replace a bus that operates in mixed traffic on a four-lane road with a tram that receives exclusive use of two of the four lanes and enjoys signal priority at intersections. There are dozens of such corridors in the San Francisco Bay Area where I live. A heavy use area, such as Geary Blvd or Van Ness Ave in San Francisco, might instead justify an underground metro or tram. Regardless, the transit corridor should be funded by those who own cars within a half mile or a mile of the corridor and by those who currently drive on the corridor. A half mile radius would be appropriate for a tram since it means about a ten minute walk (or less) for anyone within that half mile. A mile or more radius would be appropriate for funding a metro or regional rail that can attract users from farther away by using bikes, trams, autonomous cars, or minor buses to reach it. As a simple example, consider a potential ten mile tram line that currently has </span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The (2) 100,000 vehicles using the corridor daily also pay on average $100 per year for parking surcharges (whether public or private parking), making another </span><span

                    class="c2 c0">&nbsp;would be generated each year to build and maintain the ten mile tram line and the infrastructure improvements to accompany it, without even considering ticket revenue and government funding. The financial hardship to the drivers is a pittance (at most $200/year for the combined vehicle ownership and parking surcharge), probably not even enough initially to significantly alter driving behavior. All of these fees would be increased yearly a bit beyond inflation to discourage car driving and ownership as the tram line and accompanying infrastructure became available and increasingly attractive to use, a double-win for transit use. Such financing schemes are simple and fair and need not be controversial if the people that use cars in a given corridor pay specifically for high-quality transit on that corridor. Arguably the car users are paying to decrease the congestion that they are causing (and suffering from), and thus all payments can be considered a corridor usage fee rather than a tax (this only matters for political and legal reasons). More transit-progressive cities and regions might be politically able to pool funds from the region to fund improvements throughout the region, but such funding severs the connection between the reward of abandoning a car and getting high quality transit in the place where one previously owned or used a car. In the likely case that autonomous cars eliminate most car ownership, a simple per mile or minute surcharge should be placed on the cars using the corridor to maintain transit funding.</span>

            <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0 c4">A Sample Charter for User-Experience on Transit</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The funding example above shows that simple, straightforward financing could provide plentiful revenue to support high quality transit. It does not in itself however incentivize transportation planners to provide riders with an excellent user-experience. User-experience is not just a financial challenge but a business and societal one as well. We need to start with a charter that stipulates the priorities of public transportation. Such a legally-binding charter would give equal weight to several priorities. For instance:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Preamble: Active-transportation-supported transit, not automobiles, is the only form of transportation that improves rather than denigrates the environment, equity, economy, social and public health, and urban aesthetics of cities and other settled places. A 90 percent or greater non-auto mode share shall be considered meeting the requirements of this charter. Such a percentage of mode-shift requires investment in high quality user-experience on transit to appeal to the vast majority of the population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">1. Expectation of overwhelming safety onboard, at stations, and on designated approaches to the transit. Safety is enforced by the frequent presence of friendly fare inspectors, conductors, and other officials. It is also enforced by dedicated right-of-way for the vehicles, frequent service, plentiful seating, a constant baseline of ridership (a minimum presence of riders mean safer vehicles), and failing all else complete coverage by surveillance cameras and the latest safety technology. Good behavior by all users of the system is strictly enforced by officials, to at least the level that it is enforced on AMTRAK or airplanes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">2. Expectation of convenience in terms of frequent, time-efficient vehicles. This is accomplished by investment in a high frequency schedule, even at off-peak times, and by eliminating all non-designated stops. Additionally stops are limited to neighborhood centers and important intersections so that average trips have a maximum of 5-8 stops, depending on the type of service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">3. Expectation of comfort approximating that of a regional train, or at least that of an airplane or private car. This is accomplished by almost always have a surplus of comfortable seats and access to amenities, such as bathrooms, caf&eacute;s, and private compartments that can be reasonably provided by the service type. It also means the ride is always smooth due to using a well maintained fixed guideway and the highest quality vehicles. Similarly stations and stops offer the level comfort and amenities of the best existing train stations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">4. Capital improvements, operations, and maintenance, and supporting public space infrastructure funding is adequate to easily meet the above expectations. Funding is not borne by the users of the system; users are expected to minimally support the system with fares so that they pay directly for a service and thus expect excellent value from it. The goal of the system is to maximize the percent of overall trips that might otherwise be done with a car (and by a plane in the case of high-speed-rail). Fares should be set to maximize usage and never revenue. The system shall therefore be funded to scale to comfortably support 90 percent mode-share between transit, bikes, and walking. 90 percent of transit funding should come from private car ownership, parking, driving, and taxi or autonomous car usage fees in order to remove the subsidies and externalities of cars and thus discourage them in favor of sustainable modes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">5. All revenues and expenditures are tightly scrutinized, but scrutinized with the goal of most effectively satisfying the aforementioned expectations. Funding is not scrutinized in order to minimize the level of service or maximize the occupancy load of vehicles. It is understood that a transit vehicle that is half to three-quarters full is the ideal, and mostly empty vehicles are preferable in terms of service quality to full vehicles with no available seating.</span>

            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4 c1 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Right now in the USA and elsewhere, there is a scarcity culture about infrastructure and especially public space and transit. The result is petty fighting among advocates concerning one transit corridor versus another, mis-investments in bad user-experience modes like bus rapid transit, and little ability to recognize that substantial and increasing fees on car use is the only way to restore our urban environments to a human-focus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The only solution, as I see it, is to change our thinking about what we want public transit and its accompanying amenities to be. We need to bring the best of American (or your country&rsquo;s) culture to transit, not the worst. In the case of American culture, this means friendly but orderly, It means a lot of comfort and a little luxury. It means plenty of free space and the chance to pay a little for privacy. It means good behavior that is enforced by officials along with the (often loud) encouragement by the public. It means getting around quickly without having to wait and fixing inefficiencies that arise. Americans also like fairness, and any sensible one of us can see that car use is unfair, whether in terms of allocation of public space or destroying the environment (and climate) in which others live. Let us use the money wasted on cars to achieve transit that has both abundance of service </span><span
                    class="c9 c0">and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;abundance of excellent user-experience. They are both essential to the massive cultural appeal of transit, which we once possessed &nbsp;and must now regain.</span>
